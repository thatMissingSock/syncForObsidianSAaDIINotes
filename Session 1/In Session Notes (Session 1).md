#### Definitions
*Scope creep* - when the requirements change midway through the development cycle (after the sign off process)
*Domain expertise* - someone who is well versed in how the system will be used by the business and any other complexities that may need to be added (ATC FAILURE)
*Third-party company* == CoTS
*Outsource* == bespoke software
*Analysis* - is the "what" of a system (this is more functional-oriented)
*Design* - is the 
#### Past mistakes
- "scope creep" tends to be a big issue based on the wiki page
- costs are *almost* always underestimated
- system analysis will tell you what is inside the scope and what is not 

#### Structure Matters
- without a structure of the development the following occurs:
	- costs can skyrocket (be unpredictable)
	- deadlines are missed
	- the product **does not meet expectations**
	- reworking as a lot of time is spent fixing the mistakes (which are avoidable)
- without a structure, the above occurs more often than not as the scope was "ill-defined"
- you can get a structure by using the following to help identify the requirements:
	- interviews (with the customer)
	- questionnaires
	- observations
	- market research (researching the competitors) 
	- checking previous documents

#### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1. Requirements are clear and agreed upon
2. progress is predictable
3. software quality is high

- With SDLC complexities can be manages effectively (measure twice, cut once)
- You can deliver software that meets user needs
